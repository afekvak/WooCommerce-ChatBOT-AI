mcp backend notes : 
when switching to a real domain we need to change server.ts to run on the domain

in app.ts add allowed domains so they can use the chatbot

in chatgpt.ts real openai key we use
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
and in env change model
LLMMODEL = "gpt 3.5"

for use with open router for free testing
apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_KEY,
baseURL: process.env.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL
and in completion func change model to a free model like 
LLMMODEL = "minimax/minimax-m2:free"

in widget.js when using real domain switch this in env
MCPURLDATASERVER = "http://(address)/chat"

and in the widget change out the local adress 
src="http://(address)/widget.js?v=3"
data-server="http://(address)/chat"

to run in dev mod - npm run dev (runs nodemon and auto restarts)
to run in build mod - npm start (this creates the dist folder)
